## Smart Contract for Peer-to-Peer Transactions with Deadline and Interest

### Overview
This smart contract facilitates peer-to-peer transactions between friends, peers, or any two parties where one party lends money or provides goods to the other. It incorporates features such as setting a deadline for repayment and charging interest on a daily basis after the deadline has passed.

### Features
1. **Transaction Initiation**: Allows one party to initiate a transaction by specifying the sender and receiver addresses, item price, repayment deadline, interest rate, and whether collateral is provided.
2. **Deadline Enforcement**: Enforces a deadline for repayment, after which the transaction is considered overdue.
3. **Interest Calculation**: Charges interest on a daily basis for late payments based on the specified interest rate.
4. **Collateral Option**: Provides an option to specify whether collateral is provided as security for the transaction.
5. **Transaction Completion**: Marks the transaction as completed once repayment is made or when collateral is used.

### Usage
1. **Initialization**: To initiate a transaction, both parties must agree on the terms including the sender and receiver addresses, item price, repayment deadline, interest rate, and collateral provision.
2. **Repayment**: The receiver must repay the loan or return the goods before the deadline to avoid additional charges. If repayment is not made by the deadline, interest will accrue on a daily basis.
3. **Interest Calculation**: After the deadline has passed, interest is calculated based on the specified interest rate and the number of days overdue.
4. **Transaction Completion**: Once the repayment is made, the transaction is marked as completed, and any collateral provided is returned. If collateral is used, the transaction is completed, and the collateral is retained.


### Deployment
1. Deploy the smart contract to a suitable blockchain platform such as Ethereum or Aeternity.
2. Interact with the deployed contract using client-side applications or decentralized applications (dApps) to initiate transactions, track repayments, and manage collateral.

### Considerations
- **Security**: Ensure secure handling of funds and sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: Design the contract to handle a large number of transactions efficiently.
- **Gas Fees**: Consider gas fees for contract interactions, especially for frequent transactions.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Comply with relevant regulations and legal requirements for financial transactions.

### Disclaimer
This smart contract is provided as a template and should be thoroughly reviewed, tested, and customized according to specific requirements before deployment in a production environment. The contract author and deployer assume no responsibility for any misuse or unintended consequences arising from the use of this contract.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
